# The Heroes of Computer Science

**The Heroes of Computer Science** is an educational 2D game developed in Unity, designed to teach children key information about the most important figures in computer science history. Each scientist in the game is represented by a unique mini-game, offering an engaging way to learn about their contributions, followed by a trivia quiz to reinforce what was learned.

### Featured Scientists
- **Alan Turing**
- **Edsger Dijkstra**
- **Grace Hopper** *(In development)*
- **John McCarthy**
- **Margaret Hamilton**
- **Tim Berners-Lee**

### Game Features
- Each mini-game is uniquely designed to reflect the contributions of the featured scientist.
- All visuals are AI-generated (using DALL·E) and further edited with various online tools, creating a distinct aesthetic for each mini-game.
- The project serves as a learning experience in 2D Unity development and game design, helping me practice and improve my skills in a practical way.
